# CIND820 - Big Data Analytics Project
Context Awareness in Data Mining: Gaining Deeper and More Accurate Data Insights

**Project Overview**

This project explores context-aware data mining, focusing on how incorporating external contextual data can improve classification and clustering results. The study utilizes data from the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol, and Drugs Survey (CSTADS), augmented with provincial data on advertising restrictions, legal policies, and substance regulations.

**Repository Structure**

This repository includes the following components:

1. Documentation

README.md - The current file, summarizing the project.

Technical Reports:

Literature_review.doc - Literature review on context-aware data mining, as well as an explanation of the dataset, feature engineering, and modeling approach.

CSTADS_Preliminary_Analysis.ipynb - Preliminary data prep.

CSTADS Initial Results and Code.ipynb - Initial findings from clustering and classification analyses.

Compiled Reports:

PDF/HTML versions of the RMarkdown/Jupyter Notebook reports.

2. Data

Primary Dataset: CSTADS Survey Data that can be found here:
https://open.canada.ca/data/dataset/1f15ca45-8bfd-4f9c-9ec6-2c0c440e69c2

Contextual Data: Provincial datasets on advertising restrictions, legal policies, and substance regulations.

Processed Data Files: Cleaned and merged datasets used in analyses.

3. Code

Data Preparation & Cleaning:

CSTADS_Preliminary_Ananlysis.ipynb - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardization.

Clustering and Classification Analysis:

CSTADS Initial Results and Code.ipynb - 
Clustering - Implements K-Means and DBSCAN clustering as well as PCA-based cluster visualization.
Classification - Implements Random Forest and Logistic Regression with k-Fold cross-validation.
